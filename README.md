# Number Master: The Guessing Game 🎲

Can you beat the computer? This is a logic-based game where the user must guess a randomly generated number within a specific number of attempts.

## 🎮 How it Works
1. The computer picks a secret number between [e.g., 1 and 100].
2. The player gets a **limited number of chances** to guess it.
3. After each guess, the app tells you if your guess was too high or too low.
4. **The End:** - If you guess it right: You get a **"You Win! 🎉"** message.
   - If you run out of chances: You get a **"Game Over! 💀"** message with the correct number revealed.

## ✨ Features
* **Chance Tracker:** Keeps count of remaining attempts.
* **Smart Hints:** Tells the user to go higher or lower.
* **Clean Logic:** Handles input validation and game state.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** [e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++]
* **Logic:** Random number generation and conditional loops.
